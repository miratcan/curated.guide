# curated.guide

Beautiful guides for everything you love.

## What is this?

A platform where people turn their taste into beautiful, standalone guides. Think: "My skincare routine", "Best breakfast spots in Istanbul", "My 2025 tech stack".

Not a bookmark manager. Not a social network. Just beautiful guides you're proud to share.

## Philosophy

- **Pride-first:** The only product is the feeling "I curated this, and it looks like me"
- **Anti-social:** No feed, no follow, no likes, no algorithm
- **One job:** Turn your recommendations into beautiful pages

## Tech Stack

- Django + HTMX
- PostgreSQL (prod), SQLite (dev)
- No Docker unless necessary
- Boring technology, solo-sustainable

## Status

Early stage. Building in public.
