# curated.guide – Brand Voice, Character, and Positioning

This document establishes the **language, tone, and feel** for curated.guide.  
Landing pages, in-product copy, emails, social media, and every word we publish must follow this framework.

---

## 1. Product Definition and Category

**Product name:** curated.guide  
**Category:** Curated guides platform

**Core description (short):**  
curated.guide lets you turn your taste into beautiful, standalone guides that you’re proud to share.

**Tagline (fixed):**

> **Beautiful guides for everything you love.**

(This is the single source of truth. Use it on hero, Twitter bio, Product Hunt, email footer, everywhere.)

Alternative short variants (allowed):
- “Your taste, beautifully presented.”
- “One guide. One link. Always yours.”

---

## 2. Target Users (Summary)

curated.guide solves the same problems, but now with pride + beauty at the center:

1. **Taste-Maker Creators**  
   People who get asked “What’s your skincare?” / “Which tools do you use?” and want to answer with something that looks like an extension of their personal brand.

2. **Local/Travel Experts**  
   The friend everyone asks for city recommendations. They want to stop typing the same list and just send one link that feels like “them”.

3. **Knowledge Sharers**  
   Indie hackers, consultants, teachers, newsletter writers who share stacks, reading lists, resources and want it to look intentional, not thrown together.

## 3. Brand Character (3 Words)

Still the same — because they are perfect:

1. **Calm**  
   No hype. No shouting. Shows, doesn’t tell.

2. **Honest**  
   Says exactly what it is and what it isn’t. No fluff, no promises we can’t keep.

3. **Small but serious**  
   Doesn’t pretend to be the next Facebook. Just wants to be the best at one thing: making your taste look beautiful.

These three words are sacred. Never contradict them.

---

## 4. Tone and Language Rules (unchanged – they still fit perfectly)

1. **Use “you” language.**  
   Right: “You create a guide that feels like you.”  
   Wrong: “Users create guides…”

2. **Short and clear sentences.**  
   One idea per sentence.

3. **No marketing fluff.**  
   No “revolutionary”, “game-changing”, “mind-blowing”.  
   Just say the truth.

4. **Casual but not frivolous.**  
   Conversational is okay. Bro-speak or excessive emojis are not.

5. **Minimal technical terms.**  
   We say “guide”, not “micro-site” or “digital garden”.

6. **Emphasis on transparency & ownership.**  
   We openly say: no tracking, no feed, no selling your data.

---

## 5. Value Proposition (Why curated.guide?)

New core trio (replace the old one entirely):

1. **Turn your taste into something beautiful.**  
   You pick what you love. We make it look like you meant it.

2. **Share one link that always stays fresh.**  
   Update once, works everywhere — bio, DMs, stories, email signature.

3. **Stop repeating yourself.**  
   No more copy-pasting the same list. Just send the link and move on with your life.

This is the new canon. Use it on landing, onboarding, everywhere.

## 6. "Who Uses It?" Blocks (updated)

### 6.1. Taste-Maker Creators
> You’re always getting asked for your skincare, camera gear, baby stuff, or tech stack.  
> Now you answer with one beautiful guide that looks like your brand — and earns money while you sleep.

### 6.2. Local/Travel Experts
> You’re the friend everyone asks “Where should we eat in [city]?”  
> Stop typing the same list. Publish once, send the link forever.

### 6.3. Knowledge Sharers
> You share your stack, reading list, or resources every week.  
> Now you share it like you mean it — clean, personal, always up-to-date.

---

## 7. Ethics and Privacy Stance (strengthened)

**What curated.guide will never do:**

1. **No feed, no algorithm, no notifications.**  
   We don’t want your attention. We want you to save your time.

2. **No selling your data or links.**  
   Your guides are yours. We just store them.

3. **You can leave anytime.**  
   One-click export to Markdown/JSON/HTML. No questions asked.

This block goes on the homepage footer and pricing page.

If no → delete and rewrite.
