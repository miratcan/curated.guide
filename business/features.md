# Product Features – curated.guide

**Core Value Proposition**  
**"Turn your taste into beautiful guides you’re proud to share."**

One topic. One permanent link. Always fresh. Always yours.  
No feed. No noise. Just you and your recommendations, perfectly presented.

## Pricing & Access (Simple, Honest, Sustainable)

- **One plan:** $5/month or $48/year (20% discount)
- **14-day free trial** (no credit card required)
- **No free tier** – because free tiers die.
- **Founder’s Pass** (lifetime free) – only 200 available, given manually by me (@miratcan) to people who truly need it or help spread the word early.
- **Everyone is equal** – no badges, no stars, no "Pro" labels, no visible hierarchy. You pay so this place exists in 10 years.
