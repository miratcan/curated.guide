# SEO & Content Strategy – curated.guide

SEO is now our main growth engine. Every guide is content. We don't need a blog.

## Core principle
Every single guide must be perfectly crawlable, beautiful in SERPs, and feel like it was written by a human who cares.

No separate blog for at least 12 months.

## What we do instead of blog

1. **Seed guides (launch day: minimum 100, target 300)**  
   You personally create high-quality guides on evergreen topics:  
   - AI tools 2025  
   - Best breakfast spots in 15 cities  
   - Books that changed my life  
   - Mechanical keyboards guide  
   - Indie hacker stack 2025  
   Each guide 15–50 items, personal notes, beautiful covers.

   These are our "blog posts". They rank.

2. **User guides = infinite content machine**  
   Every guide user creates is new, unique, helpful content.  
   Our job: make sure Google loves them (structured data, fast loading, good meta).

## Technical SEO (must be perfect day one)

- **URL structure**  
   - curated.guide/username/slug  
   - curated.guide/username → profile page (list of all guides)

- **Meta**  
   Title: “{Guide Title} – Curated by @{username}”  
   Description: first 160 chars of guide description + “A personal guide with X recommendations.”

- **Structured data**  
   ItemList or CollectionPage schema on every guide. Rich results = higher CTR.

- **OG/Twitter Cards**  
   Use cover image + title + “curated by @username”

- **Sitemap & robots**  
   Auto-generated, everything public.

## Distribution = sharing

- Users share their guides → backlinks  
- We share seed guides on Twitter/LinkedIn/Reddit with “I made this with curated.guide”  
- No paid ads, no outreach. Only organic.

## Measurement

PostHog + Vercel Analytics + Search Console  
Weekly check:
- Impressions & clicks in Search Console  
- Which seed guides rank top 10  
- Average position trend

First 6 months target: 50k monthly organic visits from seed + early user guides.

Blog only if we hit 100k/month and still have capacity.
