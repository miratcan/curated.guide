## 1. Taste-Maker Creator – "Sarah" (Primary Revenue Persona)

**Profile**
- Heavy Instagram / TikTok / YouTube creator (lifestyle, beauty, parenting, tech, fitness, etc.).
- Constantly gets DMs: “Which protein powder?”, “What camera do you use?”, “Your skincare routine?”
- Earns from affiliate links (Amazon, LTK, ShopMy, etc.).
- Already has a Linktree or similar, but it feels generic and limited.

**Current Behavior**
- Keeps lists in Notes, Notion, Google Docs or pinned stories.
- Repeatedly copies & pastes the same links in DMs.
- Uses Linktree collections or Highlights, but everything still feels scattered and ugly.

**Pain**
- Recommendations look cheap/generic → hurts personal brand.
- No good way to add context (“why I love this”).
- Affiliate parameters get lost, no click insights, lists go outdated fast.
- Answering the same question 50 times a week kills time and vibe.

**curated.guide Value**
- Creates beautiful, standalone guides: “My Holy Grail Skincare”, “Baby Must-Haves 2025”, “Home Gym Setup”.
- One link → share in bio, stories, captions, DMs — updates instantly everywhere.
- Guides look like something you'd frame → massive pride boost.
- Pro plan: click analytics, affiliate-safe link cloaking, custom domain, no branding, password protection.
- Ends DM chaos and turns repeated questions into passive income + brand elevation.

- The friend everyone asks “Where should we eat/drink/go in [city]?”
- Travels a lot or deeply knows their city.
- Constantly shares recommendations in group chats, Instagram stories, or Twitter.

**Current Behavior**
- Google Maps lists (hard to share nicely), Notes app screenshots, Notion pages, or just typing the same list over and over.
- Sends voice notes or long WhatsApp messages that get buried.

**Pain**

- Shares one link that always stays fresh.
- Friends save/bookmark it → Mike becomes the go-to authority → social capital + pride.
