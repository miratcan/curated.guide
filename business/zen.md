# The ZEN of curated.guide

## Core Philosophy
**[ZEN-ONE-JOB]** We do one thing well: Let people publish their taste as beautiful, standalone pages.  
**[ZEN-PROUD-FIRST]** The only real product is the feeling “I curated this — and it looks like me”. Everything serves this pride.  
**[ZEN-USER-FIRST]** Creator > Visitor. We make the owner’s life magically easy, the rest is secondary.  
**[ZEN-DATA-FREEDOM]** Your content is yours. One-click export forever. No lock-in, ever.

## Boundaries
**[ZEN-NOT-SOCIAL]** We are not a social network. No feed, no follow, no likes, comments, notifications, algorithm. Ever.  
**[ZEN-NOT-BOOKMARK]** We are not a private save tool. We are for publishing, not hoarding.  
**[ZEN-NO-DISCOVERY]** No explore page, no trending, no recommendation engine. Discovery happens in the real world.  
**[ZEN-ONE-OUTPUT]** The only thing that matters is the single, perfect guide page.

## Fairness
**[ZEN-FAIR-TRADE]** We charge money so this place exists in 10 years — not to get rich, not for status.  
**[ZEN-NO-STATUS]** Everyone inside is equal. No badges, no labels, no hierarchy.  
**[ZEN-NO-TRAPS]** No dark patterns. No ads. No data selling. No bait-and-switch. No graveyard free tier.

## Working Style
**[ZEN-CORE-FIRST]** Perfect the prideful creation + sharing flow until it feels inevitable. Everything else waits.  
**[ZEN-SOLO-FIT]** Every decision must be executable by one person, forever.  
**[ZEN-EASIEST-PATH]** A feature is not done until the laziest possible way works perfectly.  
**[ZEN-MEASURE-FIRST]** We ship with measurement. Decisions by data, never by opinion.

## Growth
**[ZEN-ORGANIC]** Growth comes from people being proud enough to share.  
**[ZEN-SEO-COMPOUND]** Every published guide is permanent content. SEO is our compound interest.

## Decision Filter (kullan her seferinde)
1. Does it increase the "I curated this" pride?
2. Does it make creation or sharing easier for the owner?
3. Does it complicate the product or solo execution?
4. Is it social/feed/discovery related?

İlk iki soruya "evet" + son iki soruya "hayır" değilse → öldür.

## The One Rule
> **"Make the guide owner feel proud and safe, forget the rest."**

*"Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add,  
but when there is nothing left to take away."*  - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry
